# synthetic-control-jordan
We investigate the research question of whether the refugee crisis impaired education in Jordan by performing a synthetic control analysis. We use PISA scores of Mathematics and Reading as an internationally comparable measurement of a countryâ€™s educational quality, and set 2011 as the treatment year.
